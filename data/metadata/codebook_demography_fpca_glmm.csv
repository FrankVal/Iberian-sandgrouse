UTMCODE,character,,,"10×10 km UTM grid cell code used as spatial unit (Mougeot et al., 2021).",yes,Primary key for joins across demography and landscape metrics.
Status,character,,Persistent|Extinct,Demographic status of the cell over the interval: Persistent (retained) or Extinct (lost).,yes,"Define the exact rule in Methods (e.g., occupied in both censuses vs lost)."
AREA_MN,numeric,,,Class-level landscape metric: mean patch area of the focal habitat class within the 10×10 km cell.,yes,Metric computed for the habitat class used in the paper; units depend on map resolution/CRS.
ED,numeric,,,Class-level landscape metric: edge density of the focal habitat class within the 10×10 km cell.,yes,Metric computed for the habitat class used in the paper; units depend on map resolution/CRS.
LPI,numeric,,,Class-level landscape metric: largest patch index of the focal habitat class within the 10×10 km cell.,yes,Often expressed as % of landscape (confirm your implementation).
NP,numeric,,,Class-level landscape metric: number of patches of the focal habitat class within the 10×10 km cell.,yes,Integer count; class-level.
TA,numeric,,,Class-level landscape metric: total area of the focal habitat class within the 10×10 km cell.,yes,"Area; confirm units (e.g., ha, km2, m2) from your workflow."
Year,integer,year,,Reference year / time slice associated with the metrics and/or status.,yes,
ncPALCH,character,,,Regional sector label used in the P. alchata analyses (grouping/stratification variable).,recommended,"If this is numeric in your table, switch type to integer."
